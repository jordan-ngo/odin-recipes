    <p>
      Poke (pronounced POE-keh) is a Hawaiian dish. Its name derives from the Hawaiian word "to slice or cut."
      The name is a good indicator of what the dish is because poke is traditionally sliced raw fish (usually
      tuna or octopus) that's marinated in a savory, umami-rich sauce made with soy sauce, sesame oil, and
      green onions.

      Poke can be eaten as is, but it's typically served in a poke bowl with other ingredients â€” like rice,
      vegetables, and hot sauce.

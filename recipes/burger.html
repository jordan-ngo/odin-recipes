    Bánh xèo is a crispy Vietnamese savory pancake made from rice flour, water, 
    and turmeric (sometimes coconut milk). It's typically filled with pork, 
    shrimp, and bean sprouts, then pan-fried until golden and served with fresh
    herbs, lettuce, and a dipping sauce (usually nước chấm). 
    
    The name means “sizzling cake,” referring to the sound it makes while cooking.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>6 ounces (170 g) rice flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon (8 g) cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt, divided (for table salt, use half as much by volume)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) water</li>
      <li>7 fluid ounces coconut milk (200 ml; 175 g)</li>
      <li>1 cup thinly sliced scallions, white and light green parts (from about 2 bunches)</li>
      <li>1/2 pound (227 g) thinly sliced pork belly, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1/2 pound headless small shrimp (roughly 60 shrimp per pound), peeled and deveined</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon fish sauce</li>
      <li>Cooking oil, for pan-frying</li>
      <li>1 medium yellow onion (8 ounces; 227 g), thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 pound (227 g) bean sprouts, microwaved for 1 minute</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>For the Batter:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, mix together rice flour, cornstarch, turmeric, 
      1/4 teaspoon salt, water, coconut milk, and green onions. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
    
      <li><strong>For the Filling:</strong> Meanwhile, in a medium mixing bowl, combine pork belly, shrimp, the 
      remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and fish sauce, and set aside.</li>
    
      <li><strong>To Cook:</strong> In an 8-inch nonstick skillet, heat 1 teaspoon cooking oil over medium heat until
        shimmering. Add several strands of sliced onion, about 5 pieces of pork belly, and about 5 pieces of shrimp, 
        then fry, stirring occasionally, until opaque, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
    
      <li>Stir batter to mix well, then ladle about 1/3 cup (50ml) batter into pan in a swirling motion. (You should 
        hear distinct sizzling that tells you you’re at the right temperature.) Immediately swirl batter around pan 
        to form a thin, even layer that spreads up the side of the pan; make sure the batter mostly gets under the 
        solid ingredients to prevent holes from forming around them.</li>
    
      <li>Cook, undisturbed, until edges begin to pull away from side of pan, 3 to 4 minutes. Add a small handful 
        of bean sprouts to one half of the bánh xèo.</li>
    
      <li>Continue to cook until bánh xèo is crispy and golden brown with small charred bits, 5 to 6 minutes longer. 
        Gently slide a wide silicone spatula underneath and fold in half over the bean sprouts, then transfer to a 
        wire rack. Repeat steps 3 to 6 with remaining ingredients, stirring batter each time before ladling. Bánh 
        xèo are best eaten right away as each is ready, but you can also hold them on a wire rack in a 200°F (95°C) 
        oven until ready to serve all together.</li>
    
      <li><strong>To Serve:</strong> Serve bánh xèo right away with a platter of vegetables and herbs and/or rice 
        paper (the lettuce and rice paper can be used to wrap around the bánh xèo and herbs), and <em>nước chấm</em>
         for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
